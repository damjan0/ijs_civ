`generateData3DLongevity.py`
Generates points for each Lmax and saves it to a file

`3DLongevity.py`
Plots a 3DGraph from files created from before

---------
### Clustering and Boxplots
Manualy read from a graph for different clusters. For each cluster draw a boxplot for each parameter

### Flipping N and L
Generate points and plot a 3Dgraph where N and L are changed.. calulating L for different Nmax points

### Machine Learning
Using Machine Learning to get clusters for generated points
- dAE - Deep Autoencoder
- VAE - Variational autoencoder
- tSNE

---------
`points4.csv`
